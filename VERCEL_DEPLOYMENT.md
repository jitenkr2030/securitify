# Vercel Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deploying Securitify to Vercel

### Required Environment Variables

You MUST set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

#### 1. Database Configuration
```
DATABASE_URL=file:./data/dev.db
```

#### 2. NextAuth Configuration
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here-at-least-32-characters-long
```

#### 3. Application Configuration
```
NODE_ENV=production
APP_NAME=Securitify
APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

### üîß Setup Steps

#### 1. Vercel Project Configuration
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add all the required environment variables listed above
4. Set the Build Command to: `npm run vercel-build`
5. Set the Output Directory to: `.next`

#### 2. Database Setup
The application uses SQLite with file-based storage. The database file will be automatically created at:
```
/data/dev.db
```

#### 3. Build Process
The build process includes:
- Database directory creation
- Prisma client generation
- Next.js build

### üìù Important Notes

#### Database Persistence
- Vercel's file system is ephemeral, meaning the database file may be reset between deployments
- For production use, consider using a persistent database solution like:
  - PlanetScale (MySQL)
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  - Vercel Postgres

#### Security
- Always use a strong, randomly generated `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use Vercel's environment variable encryption

#### Demo Users
The system includes demo users for testing:
- **Admin**: `admin@security.com` / `password123`
- **Guard**: `guard@security.com` / `password123`
- **Officer**: `officer@security.com` / `password123`

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to create tenant" Error**
   - Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in Vercel environment variables
   - Ensure the build process completed successfully
   - Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages

2. **NextAuth "NO_SECRET" Error**
   - Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and is at least 32 characters long
   - Check that `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your deployed URL exactly

3. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Ensure the `/data` directory exists and is writable
   - Check that the SQLite file has proper permissions
   - Verify the `DATABASE_URL` format is correct

#### Debug Steps
1. Check Vercel function logs in the dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the build process locally with `npm run vercel-build`
4. Check that the database file is accessible

### üîÑ Production Considerations

For a production deployment, consider:

1. **Database Migration**: Use a proper database service instead of SQLite
2. **File Storage**: Use cloud storage for uploaded files
3. **Email Service**: Configure a proper email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
4. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and monitoring
5. **Backup**: Implement regular database backups

### üìû Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Review the function logs for detailed error messages
3. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
4. Verify the build process completed successfully
